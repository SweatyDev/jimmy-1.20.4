Mobs:
	Jerry:
		- Follows around the player. When not in sight and 20-30 blocks away from player, it will teleport to a location near them and continue to follow.
		- Passive mob unless angry (hostile).
		- Has a "happiness" value.
			- If above 75 happiness, it will give the player gifts and be nice.
			- If it reaches 0, Jerry gets put into a permenant "Angry" state, where the player is sent to "The Shadow Realm".
			- When angry, it will be hostile. Also causes yrreJ to become hostile.
			- When angry, if the player dies in The Shadow Realm, the game will crash and the world save will be deleted.
		- Offers "tips".
			- These tips will usually save the player from imminent death, such as staying away from caves filled with scary creatures.
		- Jerry will sometimes prank the player, making Jerry happy.
		- The longer you spend on the world, the harder it is to keep Jerry happy.

		- Common mob found in the Shadow Realm.
		- Hostile if Jerry is angry.
			- If above 75 happiness, gives the players corrupted gifts.
		- Emits reversed+pitched Enderman sounds.
		- Very fast. Uses fists as weapon.
		- When killed disappears in a cloud of smoke, calling others to the area of death (like calling reinforcements).
		- Will unaggro after 10 seconds of broken sight.

	derutorT:
		- When the player does events like sleeping near villagers, the villagers have a chance to become derutorT.
		- Neutral, drops Sinew, which can be used to craft some items (?).
			- Only hostile when seen by the player.
		- Emits a painful scream and similar sounds.
		- Will try to lurk in darker areas.
